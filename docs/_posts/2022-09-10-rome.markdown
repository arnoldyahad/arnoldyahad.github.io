## Notes
1. Every first Sunday of the month there are a lot of free activities like the Colluseium and many museums.
2. There is a City Tax of 6â‚¬ per person per night.
3. Rome averages around 7-10 million visitors a year, so try to plan accordingly if you don't like crowded places.

## Sightseeing
1. **Trevi Fountain** - Amazing fountain in the center of Rome, better come early as around 11am it becomes very crowded.

2. **Colluseum + Forum Romano + Palatine hill** - all of those attractions are combined as they are very near by and accessible by a single ticket.
The line can be pretty huge (45-70 minutes) to get the ticket so better buy it in advance online. 

3. **Villa Borghese** - Amazing park, with special view over the entire city (search for Terrazza del Pincio).
There are golf cart rentals which is a great way to see the whole park, also its possible to do it on a scooter.

4.Piazza del Popolo - right near the entrance to the Villa Borghese there is a huge square with amazing sights. 

5. Pantheon - 

6. D'Angelo Bridge - 

7. The Spanish stairs -
